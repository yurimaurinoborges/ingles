        <h2>Top tips for renting a car in Sao Paulo</h2>
        <p>Home to the largest population in the Southern Hemisphere, São Paulo is a diverse metropolis with a unique cultural identity and significant economic importance. Deciding to rent a car during your trip will give you the best opportunity to fully understand the grandness of the city and explore nearby wonders and natural beauty, such as the Zu Lai Temple, the São Rogue wine region, or the many beaches and expansive coastline.</p>
        <p>The São Paulo – Guarulhos International Airport (GRU) is located 25 km (15 miles) from the city center. KAYAK assembles the greatest range and prices from global rental companies such as Avis, Budget, and Hertz, which are located within the East Arrival section of Terminal 2 of GRU Airport. Organizing your rental prior to arriving will give you the ability to get on the road quickly and maximize your time in São Paulo.</p>

    <h2>What type of car is recommended for driving in Sao Paulo?</h2>
    <p>
        A compact sedan will best suit the driving demands of São Paulo roads, helping you navigate tight positions caused by any traffic congestion. A car such as a Kia Rio Hatchback or a Nissan Micra will be perfect for Brazilian roads. Keep in mind that manual transmission cars are far more common in São Paulo, so if you would prefer to rent an automatic it may be a little more expensive</p>
